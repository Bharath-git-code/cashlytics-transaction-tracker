## Building for Android

This project includes automated GitHub Actions workflows for building Android APKs:

### ðŸš€ Quick Build (Recommended)

1. **Push changes to GitHub**
2. **Go to Actions tab** in your repository
3. **Run "Build APK (Minimal Working)"** workflow
4. **Download APK** from artifacts

### Available Workflows

- **build-apk-minimal.yml**: Fast, essential-only build
- **build-apk-complete.yml**: Comprehensive build with all tools
- **build-apk-recommended.yml**: Balanced approach (recommended)

### Manual Build (Local)

If you want to build locally:

```bash
# Install buildozer
pip install buildozer cython

# Build debug APK
buildozer android debug
```

**Note**: Local builds require Android SDK setup and can be complex. GitHub Actions is recommended for hassle-free APK generation.

### Build Status

âœ… **App Development**: Complete  
âœ… **Build Environment**: Ready  
âœ… **License Handling**: Automated  
ðŸ”„ **APK Generation**: In Progress  

See `BUILD_APK.md` for detailed build documentation and troubleshooting.
